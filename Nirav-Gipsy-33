GIPSY (General Intenstional Programming System) is an ongoing research project developed to investigate on a general solution for the evaulation purpose of programs, using a distributed demand driven evaluation model. It provides framework, which includes more than one tiers. 
Organization and management of GIPSY networks were very complex and time consuming, which used to require manual handling using command line console. So new interactive graph based assistant component has been developed that allow users to picture, represent and easilly create, configure and manage those networks virtually as a graph. It also allow users to control the all related network parameters and the interconnection among nodes at run time. 
New implementation is more focused on automation such as upon starting, a node reads its preconfigured file and establishes the connection according to the information provided in the file.
The graph based tool assists with the automation of the all system operations such as Configuration, Bootstrapping, GIPSY node registration, Tier Allocation and Tier Deallocation. 
The main aim or objective of developing s graph-based graphical user interface is to increase the usability of the running system and allowing the user to have a control over the network with very less manual intervention. This tool provides a drag and drop mechanism to change the conectivity between tiers at run time. It also allows user to seamlessly inspect the status and properties of GIPSY nodes and tiers at run time.
