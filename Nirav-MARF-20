Combining and Comparing Multiple Algorithms for Better Learning and Classification: A Case Study of MARF

This case study is intended to show the general pattern recognition pipeline design methodology, interfaces, classes and data structures 
to test and compare more than one algorithms and their combinations at the pipelineâ€™s stages. 
The main problem was to develop a tools to test  variety of patterns and NLP algorithms and their combinations for any task given.  
To compare the tool must allow us to add external plug-ins into the framework. 
The system need to have the supportive data types and structures that allow for the scripting of the recognition tasks for all potential processing.
Researchers wants this tools to be available publically as a open source project such that everyone from the community can contribute for the enhancement of the project.
At the beginning the MARF framework evolved for stand-alone, sequential and limited support for multithreading. 
Next step was to make it distributed. But there was a problem with DMARF as used to require lot of manual management. 
So further step was to make it autonomic.
MARF approach is applied to a variety experiments. Some approaches were text independent- speaker identification while other was writer indentification from scanned hand written docs. Researchers have used first and second guess statistics to find the accurate results. The framrwork is good overall but for more number of algorithms it is more difficult to adjust.
